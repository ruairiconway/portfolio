## Points of Interest
- Implementation of useState, useContext, and useEffect hooks, as well as a custom hook for watching browser width.
- Use of Styled Components.
- Contact form handled using Formspree.

## To dos
- Feedback has been hit or miss on visual style. Might need a facelift later on, more welcoming and less utilitarian.
